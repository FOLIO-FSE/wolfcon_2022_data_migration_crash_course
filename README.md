### Slack channel / getting help
If you have questions about the session or how to set up your computer, please ask in the #wolfcon-data-migration-crash-course-part-2 Slack channel.

### Prerequisites
#### Software
First of all, you need Python 3.9  or greater on you system, and a installation of Git.

Then, having access to a more fancy text editor or IDE, like (Visual Studio Code)[https://code.visualstudio.com/] or [similar](https://www.g2.com/products/visual-studio-code/competitors/alternatives) is recommended.

#### - Python 3.9 or greater
This might be a bit harder to achieve than you might think, but there are multiple ways to achieve this depending on your system. Please reach out to Google or the above-mentioned Slack channel for advice.   

In order to find out if you have the right version, please enter ```python --version``` or ```python3 --version``` into the command line. The results should look something like this:

#### - a Git installation. 
You also need to install Git. There are many option for this as well. Some prefer more visual user interfaces like [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), but a regular git installation of the (official installers)[https://git-scm.com/downloads] is preferred.
